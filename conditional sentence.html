            <p><strong>4. Third Conditional:</strong><br>
                • Structure: If + Past Perfect, would have + Past Participle<br>
                • Usage: Expresses unreal or hypothetical situations in the past<br>
                • Example meaning: If she had studied, she would have passed (past regret)</p>

            <p><strong>5. Mixed Conditional:</strong><br>
                • Structure: If + Past Perfect, would + Verb (base form)<br>
