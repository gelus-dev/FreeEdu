            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p><strong>Definition:</strong> <strong>Voice</strong> in grammar refers to the form of a verb that shows whether the subject of the sentence performs the action (Active Voice) or receives the action (Passive Voice).</p>

            <h3>Key Concepts :</h3>
            <p><strong>1. Active Voice:</strong><br>
                • The subject performs the action.<br>
                • Structure: Subject + Verb + Object<br>
                • Example: She writes a letter.</p>

            <p><strong>2. Passive Voice:</strong><br>
                • The subject receives the action.<br>
                • Structure: Object of Active Sentence + Verb (to be + past participle) + by + Subject<br>
                • Example: A letter is written by her.</p>

            <p><strong>3. Conversion Rules:</strong><br>
                • Tense must be maintained:<br>
                  - Present Simple: writes → is written<br>
                  - Past Simple: wrote → was written<br>
                  - Present Continuous: is writing → is being written<br>
                  - Past Continuous: was writing → was being written<br>
                  - Present Perfect: has written → has been written<br>
                  - Past Perfect: had written → had been written<br>
                  - Future Simple: will write → will be written<br>
                  - Future Perfect: will have written → will have been written<br>
                • Modal Verbs: can write → can be written, must write → must be written</p>

            <p><strong>4. Exceptions & Special Cases:</strong><br>
                • Imperative sentences: “Open the door.” → “Let the door be opened.”<br>
                • Verbs without objects cannot form passive: “He sleeps.” (No passive form)<br>
                • Some active sentences can omit “by” if the agent is unknown or unimportant: “The book was written in 1990.” (agent not mentioned)<br>
                • Reflexive verbs usually stay active: “He washed himself.” → Passive is awkward.<br>
                • Infinitive forms: to write → to be written, having written → having been written</p>
