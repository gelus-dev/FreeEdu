            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p><strong>Definition:</strong> <strong>Tense Sequence</strong> refers to the rule of maintaining logical relationship of tenses between the main clause and subordinate clause in a sentence.</p>

            <h3>Key Concepts :</h3>
            <p><strong>1. General Rule:</strong><br>
                • If the verb in the main clause is in past tense, the verb in the subordinate clause usually also goes to past tense.<br>
                • If the verb in the main clause is in present or future tense, the verb in the subordinate clause can be in any tense as required.</p>

            <p><strong>2. Present/Future in Main Clause:</strong><br>
                • Subordinate clause can take any tense.<br>
                • Example: He says that he is happy. / He will say that he was ill.</p>

            <p><strong>3. Past in Main Clause:</strong><br>
                • Subordinate clause usually takes past tense.<br>
                • Example: He said that he was ill.</p>

            <p><strong>4. Exceptions to Past Rule:</strong><br>
                • Universal truths remain in present tense even if the main clause is past.<br>
                • Example: He said that the earth is round.<br>
                • If the subordinate clause shows a future event relative to the past, "would/should + V1" is used.<br>
                • Example: He said that he would come.</p>

            <p><strong>5. Reported Speech Application:</strong><br>
                • Direct speech → Indirect speech follows tense sequence.<br>
                • Example: Direct: He said, "I am tired." → Indirect: He said that he was tired.</p>
