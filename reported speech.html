            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p><strong>Definition:</strong> <strong>Reported Speech</strong>, also called indirect speech, is the way of reporting what someone else has said without quoting their exact words.</p>

            <h3>Key Concepts :</h3>
            <p><strong>1. Direct vs Indirect Speech:</strong><br>
                • Direct: She said, "I am reading a book."<br>
                • Indirect: She said that she was reading a book.</p>

            <p><strong>2. Changes in Reported Speech:</strong><br>
                • **Tense:** Usually shifts back one tense in past reporting.<br>
                  - Present → Past: "I am happy" → He said that he was happy.<br>
                  - Present Perfect → Past Perfect: "I have finished" → He said that he had finished.<br>
                  - Past → Past Perfect: "I went there" → He said that he had gone there.<br>
                  - Future → Conditional: "I will come" → He said that he would come.<br>
                • **Pronouns:** Change according to context.<br>
                  - "I" → "he/she", "my" → "his/her"<br>
                • **Time expressions:** Adjust according to reporting time.<br>
                  - today → that day, tomorrow → the next day, yesterday → the day before</p>

            <p><strong>3. Reporting Verbs:</strong><br>
                • Common verbs: said, told, asked, requested, ordered, advised<br>
                • "Told" requires an object: He told me that…<br>
                • "Said" can be used without an object: He said that…</p>

            <p><strong>4. Questions in Reported Speech:</strong><br>
                • Yes/No questions: use 'if/whether'<br>
                  - Direct: "Are you coming?" → Indirect: He asked if I was coming.<br>
                • Wh-questions: keep the question word<br>
                  - Direct: "Where do you live?" → Indirect: He asked where I lived.</p>

            <p><strong>5. Commands & Requests:</strong><br>
                • Positive command: "Close the door" → He asked me to close the door.<br>
                • Negative command: "Don’t touch it" → He told me not to touch it.<br>
                • Requests: "Please help me" → He requested me to help him.</p>

            <p><strong>6. Exceptions & Special Cases:</strong><br>
                • If reporting verb is in present, tense change is not necessary.<br>
                  - Direct: "I am tired," he says → Indirect: He says that he is tired.<br>
                • Modal verbs 'can', 'may', 'must' change in past:<br>
                  - can → could, may → might, must → had to<br>
                • Some words remain unchanged: should, might, could, would</p>
